# Dynamic Array C
Some dynamic array macro functions.
Feel free to take a quick look at the source code. It has some nice comments.
All you need is dynamicarray.h and you should be good to go.
For error handling, you can either check to make sure the dynamic array has been correctly initialized, or you can edit the actual header file and replace the println call with your own error handle.
